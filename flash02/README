information.

This one erases the user/program flash and places a simple led blinker
program.  If you had something there it gets wiped out, you have been
warned.

When you power cycle or reset it runs the blinker program.

This flash02 program runs in sram, follow the openocd instructions to
load and run the flash02.sram.elf program at 0x01000000
