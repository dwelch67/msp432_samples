information.

While I do not in any way shape or form condone using a timer and
interrupts to demonstrate how to blink an LED.  I do condone using
an LED to develop and test development of an interrupt handler.

This example uses TIMER32 number 1 and interrupts.  See the research
directory as you should never just bang out code to handle interrupts
you should always take it very slow almost one line of code at a time
doing research using polling then when you have exhausted all you can
do with polling then do the last step or few.  This is not a YMMV thing
this is a you will spend significantly more time be it hours or weeks
trying to get what could take you minutes to an hour to do.

The example in this directory is simply a modification of the research
that used the uart.  Its the final answer does not show the work it
took to get there.  The subdirectory was left in place for that.

As with almost all of these examples it is assumed flash03 was used
to put an infinite loop program down before running this program in
sram.
