See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information, and how to load and run this program.

Very simple led blinker.  LED blinking and this example are basically
the printf("Hello World!\n"); of baremetal.

As mentioned in the top level README

The schematic shows that LED1 is on P1.0, which can be confusing as
we get into the ti documentation they use terms like PORT A so P1.0
on the pin side of things is PORT A bit 0.

This program stops the WDT, configures P1.0 as an output and then turns
it on and off.  A counting loop if done right (so it doesnt optimize
away) will suffice for killing enough time so a human can see the led
toggle between on and off.  Later blinker examples will use timers and
get accurate control over that rate.  No reason to assume or try to
tune this loop for a specific time, saying that though if you say double
the DELAY_COUNT value it should show as a change in the on/off toggle
time, demonstrating that you were able to change the program and
see that change reflected.
